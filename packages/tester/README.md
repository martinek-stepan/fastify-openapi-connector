# Custom Identities API

REST API service for managing custom identity operations and integration with external identity providers.

## Description

This API service handles custom identity management operations within the AMS platform. It provides endpoints for user management with Entra ID, group management, and integration with external systems like SCIM and SSO providers. The service runs as a Docker container on AWS Fargate and integrates with Essay, and PACE.
